# Text-to-3D Generator 🧊

This project allows you to generate simple 3D models (like pyramids) from text or code-based descriptions using Python. It's ideal for prototyping and educational demonstrations of text-to-geometry generation.

## 🔧 Features

- Generate basic 3D shapes from scratch (e.g., pyramid)
- Export models in `.obj` format (viewable in Blender, Unity, etc.)
- Clean and simple implementation using `trimesh`
- Easily extendable for more complex 3D shapes

## 📁 Files

- `text_to_3d.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook to generate a pyramid
- `pyramid.obj` – Output 3D model file
- `LICENSE` – Open-source license for reuse
- `README.md` – Project overview
